        Understanding What ADHD Is
      </h2>

        Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood condition that can impact a child’s ability to focus, stay organized, and manage impulses. If you suspect your child might have ADHD, seeking a proper diagnosis and exploring management strategies are crucial steps towards helping them thrive.

          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-700">
            ADHD encompasses a spectrum of presentations, from primarily inattentive symptoms to those that include hyperactive and impulsive behaviors. Inattentive symptoms in children with ADHD may involve:

          <ul class="mt-4 space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
            {[
              "Difficulty maintaining focus during tasks or play",
              "Frequent forgetfulness and misplaced belongings",
              "Disorganization and trouble completing tasks",
              "Tendency to daydream and get lost in thought",
              "Difficulty following instructions",
            ].map((t) => (

            ))}
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-700">
            Hyperactive and impulsive behaviors can include fidgeting, restlessness, excessive movement, acting without thinking, difficulty waiting their turn, blurting out answers, or staying still in quiet settings.
            <br /><br />
            Remember that these symptoms can manifest differently in each child. Some may present primarily with inattentiveness, while others might struggle greater with hyperactivity and impulsivity. Dr. Okonkwo will conduct a thorough, empathetic evaluation to determine the specific type and severity of your child’s ADHD, ensuring personalized support for their unique needs.

          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-700">
            Managing your child’s ADHD or attention problems can feel like a frustrating challenge. 
            Dr. Okonkwo, Functional Medicine ADHD certified, offers help with a holistic, functional 
            medicine approach to treating ADHD, addressing root causes instead of merely managing symptoms. 
            This perspective, grounded in functional medicine, views ADHD as a multifaceted condition influenced 
            by neurobiological, environmental, genetic, nutritional, and lifestyle factors.
            <br /><br />
            Targeted testing identifies contributing factors to a patient’s symptoms. Treatment strategies restore 
            equilibrium based on those specific factors. Personalized treatment plans remain essential, as each 
            patient’s symptoms and contributing factors prove unique.
            <br /><br />
            This journey includes a 6-month plan to identify and address ADHD causes. It follows a step-wise approach 
            tailored to each individual patient, with specific testing and treatment plans implemented each month. 
            Upon completing the six-month program, we recommend continuing care via membership in the holistic ADHD 
            program to support your child’s ongoing success in managing ADHD.
            <br /><br />
            This holistic, functional medicine approach empowers children with ADHD and their families to take an 
            active role in their healing journey, with potential to reduce or eliminate medication needs. 
            Ultimately, holistic care provides a sustainable path toward improved attention, emotional balance, 
            and quality of life.
